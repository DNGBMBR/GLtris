# GLtris
GLTris is a custom multiplayer block stacking game implementation designed with the ability to extend the game with different pieces and rotation systems in mind.

# Multiplayer Setup
To set up multiplayer, download the latest release and go to the GLTrisServer folder. Set up port forwarding on the machine hosting the server, ensuring the protocol is set to UDP or TCP&UDP and the port matches the port listed in server.properties.
Players can then connect to the server by opening the main game, going to the multiplayer menu, and entering the IP address of the server and the corresponding port. The game is started by typing "start" (without quotation marks) in the server window's text box.
